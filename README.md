Block Refresh
=============

As the name implies, Block Refresh is a module that lets people configure all
or some of their blocks to be refreshed, either automatically in a defined
number of seconds or by providing a link that can be clicked on to refresh
the block content, or both!

Note: the current working version of this module depends on this core fix:
  https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues/issues/2713


Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

- Visit the Layout configuration page at Administration > Structure > Layouts
  (admin/structrre/layouts) and Manage Blocks for a layout.

- Configure a block you would like to refresh, and define the settings under
  the "Refresh settings" fieldset.

  Note: The inner element with the class .block-content will be replaced when
  the block refreshes. If your block does not have this class, the contents of
  the whole block will be replaced including the block title.
